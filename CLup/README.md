>**IMPORTANT**
> 
> This application requires camera access to work properly (the store manager has to scan tickets). Due to security costraints all navigation browsers (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Safari) don't allow the web page to access the device features (like the camera) outside of `localhost` when the connection is not secure (HTTP instead of HTTPS). For more information: [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts).

>The only solution is avaiable on Chrome and consists of adding the webserver's IP to the trusted lists.

## Network Setup
* Your Machine hosting the webserver and your Smartphone must be on the same local network. In this way you can connect using the local IP address instead of the public one, avoiding any unecessary port forwarding on the router.
* When configuring the Smartphone always use the local IP Address.

## Enjoy CLup
Now you can go to `http://IP_OF_THE_MACHINE_YOU_ARE_RUNNING_NODE:3000` and use CLup!
