<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project has been developed as final assignment for the _Software Engineering II_ course held by Professor Elisabetta Di Nitto at _Politecnico di Milano_.

The objective of this project was to apply in practice what we learned during lectures with the purpose of becoming familiar with software engineering practices and able to address new software engineering issues in a rigorous way. The project was divided into three assignments:
1. The preparation of a Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD) starting from an informal description of the problem.
2. The definition of the Design Document (DD) for the system considered in point 1.
3. The implementation of a running prototype of the system designed in point 2, using also automated tools to perform testing. 

This application was designed during COVID-19 pandemic and wants to foster a safe shopping experience by providing a customer flow control system. 
This system should allow the users to avoid crowds both inside and outside the stores.
The system should also be very simple to use (to adapt to all demographics) and provide fallback options for those who do not have access to the application.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Mockups

These are the mockups of the mobile version of the web application that are also included in the Design Document.
The real implementation may have some differences.
